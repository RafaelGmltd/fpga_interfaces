# *UART CORDIC*

Let me start by clarifying that `I am not the original author of this project and I do not claim credit for someone else‚Äôs work.`
`All the core development was done by Grant Yu.`

I only made minor modifications ‚Äî I added an external tick generator module and replaced the FIFO with a more general-purpose one.
Most importantly, I studied and analyzed his project thoroughly, as my primary goal is learning and gaining a deeper understanding.

The goal of this project is to implement, in FPGA hardware, a CORDIC computation block that converts a user-specified angle into its sine and cosine values.

## Python Client Script

On the PC side, a Python script is used to send data to the FPGA over UART. The script performs the following tasks:
Opens the serial port with a specified baud rate  and odd parity;
Takes an angle input from the user in degrees, converts it to radians, and then to a fixed-point format Q4.44 using the FixedPoint library;
Builds a data packet that includes a header, command byte, and the encoded angle value;
Calculates an 8-bit CRC over the entire packet using a polynomial 0x9B (via LFSR method);
Sends the packet to the FPGA over UART;
Receives a response, which contains cos(Œ∏) and sin(Œ∏) values in Q2.46 fixed-point format, and performs CRC-8 verification.
The script supports two operation modes:

1. Single-angle transmission ‚Äî sends one angle at a time;
2. Burst transmission ‚Äî allows sending up to 8 angles in one packet.

## FPGA Data Handling
Once the packet is received by the FPGA, it goes through the following processing stages:

### `uart_rx module:`

Receives the packet byte by byte;

Performs basic framing and integrity checks (e.g., stop bit, parity);

Passes the complete packet to the next stage if no UART-level errors are detected.

### `rx_msg module:`

Parses the packet;

Extracts the command byte and angle data;

Forwards the command byte directly to the tx_msg module;

Sends the angle (`in fixed-point Q4.44`) to the cordic_sincos computational module.

### `cordic_sincos module:`

Computes cos(Œ∏) and sin(Œ∏) using a fully pipelined CORDIC algorithm;
Outputs the results `in fixed-point Q2.46 format`.

### `tx_msg module:`

Receives the command byte and computed values;
Assembles a new response packet including header, command, cos(Œ∏), sin(Œ∏), and recalculated CRC-8;
Pushes the completed packet to an output FIFO to decouple computation from transmission.

### `uart_tx module:`

Reads the response packet from the FIFO;
Sends it byte-by-byte back over UART to the Python client.

### Client-side (Python):

Validates the returned packet with CRC-8;
Converts the fixed-point values back to floating-point;
Displays the results to the user.

# Parity Bit Generation on Transmission:

Before sending a byte:

Take 8 bits of data (for example, data = 8'b10110010)
Count the number of ones: num_ones = 4
Based on the parameter PARITY_EO:

- If PARITY_EO = 0 (even parity):
  parity_bit   = ^data (XOR of all bits)
  ‚Üí This bit will be 0 when the total number of ones is even.

- If PARITY_EO = 1 (odd parity):
  parity_bit   = ~(^data) (inverted XOR)
  ‚Üí This ensures that the total number of ones becomes odd.

The generated parity_bit is inserted after the 8 data bits, just before the stop bit.

# Parity Check :

After receiving 8 data bits, one parity bit is read (only if PARITY_ON = 1).
Count the number of ones in the 8 data bits ‚Üí num_ones

Perform the check based on PARITY_EO:

**If PARITY_EO = 0 (even parity):**
**(num_ones + parity_bit) % 2 == 0**

**If PARITY_EO = 1 (odd parity):**
**(num_ones + parity_bit) % 2 == 1**

If the condition fails, a parity error is detected and the packet is considered corrupted.

# What is CRC-8 and Why It's Used:

CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) is a method for verifying data integrity. In this project, CRC-8 with generator polynomial 0x9B (binary 10011011) is used.

### How CRC-8 Works on Transmission:

Before sending a packet (header, command, data), CRC-8 is calculated over all bytes.
The resulting 1-byte CRC is appended to the end of the packet.
The full packet is then sent over UART.

### How CRC-8 Works on Reception:

On the receiver side (in uart_rx or rx_msg), CRC-8 is recomputed over the entire received packet, including the CRC byte.
If the final CRC result is 0, the packet is valid.
If the result is non-zero, a transmission error is detected ‚Äî the packet is considered corrupted.

# Fixed-Point (Fractional)

A fixed-point number has:

1. An integer part (before the decimal point)
2. A fractional part (after the decimal point)

It can be either signed or unsigned.

### Unsigned Fixed-Point Number

Represents only positive values (including zero)
All bits are used for magnitude
Example: Q4.4 unsigned

- 4 bits for integer part ‚Üí range: 0 to 15

- 4 bits for fractional part ‚Üí resolution: 1/16

### Signed Fixed-Point Number

Represents both negative and positive values
The most significant bit (MSB) is the sign bit (0 = positive, 1 = negative)
Typically uses two‚Äôs complement representation
Example: Q4.4 signed

- 4 bits for integer part ‚Üí range: -8 to +7

- 4 bits for fractional part ‚Üí resolution: 1/16

# "Two's Complement"

Two's complement is a method for representing negative numbers in binary.
Positive numbers are represented as usual in binary.

To represent a negative number:
Invert all bits of the positive version (NOT operation).
Add 1 to the result.

Example:

Let‚Äôs say we want to represent ‚Äì3 using 4 bits.

- Binary of +3 = 0011
- Invert bits: 1100
- Add 1: 1100 + 1 = 1101

So, `‚Äì3 = 1101 in 4-bit two‚Äôs complement`.

### Example: Number 2.5 in unsigned Q4.44 format

1. Unsigned Q4.44 format:  
- 4 bits for the integer part (no sign)  
- 44 bits for the fractional part  
- Total 48 bits.

2. Convert the number to fixed-point:  
   `2.5 * 2^44 = 43,980,465,111,040`

3. Convert to binary:  
   Represent the integer 43,980,465,111,040 as a 48-bit binary number or hex (280000000000)
   You can use the script located in the Python folder named `angle_conversions.py` to verify the result ‚Äî it will output 2.5.

4. Result:  
This 48-bit unsigned integer is the fixed-point representation of 2.5 in Q4.44.

   To convert back to a floating-point number:
   `43,980,465,111,040 / 2^44 = 2.5`

So, for unsigned fixed-point numbers, you just multiply the floating number by \(2^{\text{fractional bits}}\) 
and convert to an integer ‚Äî this integer is the fixed-point encoding.

## Input Angle Preprocessing in CORDIC (`cordic_sincos_preprocess` Module)

- The input angle is given in fixed-point format **Q4.44**, with a full range from **-2œÄ** to **+2œÄ**.
- The normalization process maps the angle to the range **[-œÄ/2, +œÄ/2]**, since the main CORDIC rotation range is ¬±œÄ/2.

Normalization rules:

- If the angle is within **[-œÄ/2, œÄ/2]**   , no change is applied.
- If the angle is in     **(œÄ/2, 3œÄ/2]**   , subtract œÄ and invert the sign of the results (sin and cos).
- If the angle is in     **(3œÄ/2, 2œÄ]**    , subtract 2œÄ.
- If the angle is in     **[-3œÄ/2, -œÄ/2)** , add œÄ and invert the sign of the results.
- If the angle is in     **[-2œÄ, -3œÄ/2)**  , add 2œÄ.

These operations are implemented via logical checks and arithmetic on the Q4.44 angle value.

After normalization, the angle is shifted left by 2 bits (converted from **Q4.44** to **Q2.46**) to scale it to the format of the coefficient and arctangent lookup tables used in the main CORDIC stages.

## Explanation of the CORDIC Algorithm

CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) is an iterative algorithm used to compute trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine, as well as other functions. It is based on a sequence of vector rotations by predefined angles.

Suppose we have an input angle in fixed-point format, and we want to calculate its sine and cosine. Recall that `the cosine corresponds to the X-axis projection`, while `the sine corresponds to the Y-axis projection` . Somewhere on the unit circle lies the point that represents our desired angle, but its exact coordinates are unknown. We approximate this point step by step by rotating a vector through a sequence of predefined angles.

These rotation angles are precomputed and stored in an arctangent lookup table located in the file `pkg_cordic_sincos.sv`. The table contains values of 
`arctan (2^(‚àíùëñ))` used in each iteration.

### Initial State

The rotation begins from a vector pointing along the X-axis, which corresponds to angle zero:
- cos(0) = 1 
- sin(0) = 0

However, it's important to note that we do not start with a cosine value of exactly 1. Instead, we initialize it with a scaling factor K. This is because each CORDIC rotation slightly increases the vector's length due to the approximation used. To correct for this, a scaling coefficient ùêæ is applied, which depends on the number of iterations.

In the code, the initialization looks like this:
- assign cos_o = K[ STAGES-1 ]; // initial cos value with scaling
- assign sin_o = '0;          // initial sin value is zero

The values of the scaling factor ùêæ are also predefined and stored in `pkg_cordic_sincos.sv`.

### Iteration Process in CORDIC

Now that we have defined the initial state of the vector, the iterative process begins. In each iteration, the vector is rotated by an angle of approximately 
arctan(2^(‚àíùëñ)) i is the iteration number.

This is done using the following update equations:

![Equations](cordic.jpg)

- X(i) Y(i)         `are the current vector coordinates (cosine and sine)`
- Œ∏(i)              `is the current residual angle`
- d(i) = sign(Œ∏(i)) `determines the direction of rotation: if Œ∏(i) >= 0 the vector is rotated clockwise, otherwise counterclockwise`

In Verilog, this logic is implemented using shift operations and sign checks (avoiding multiplications):

- assign delta_cos   = ( theta_i[ BITS-1 ] ?  sin_i : -sin_i ) >>> STAGE  ;  
- assign delta_sin   = ( theta_i[ BITS-1 ] ? -cos_i :  cos_i ) >>> STAGE  ;
- assign delta_theta = ( theta_i[ BITS-1 ] ? ATAN[ STAGE]  : (-ATAN[ STAGE ]) ;

`>>> STAGE == /2^i`
`theta_i[ BITS-1 ] == MSB(theta_i)`

In each step, we rotate the vector in a direction that reduces the residual angle Œ∏(i) , bringing it closer to zero.

### Number of Iterations

The more iterations are performed, the higher the precision of the result. In your case, 48 iterations are used, which yields high-precision sine and cosine values for the input angle, represented in FixedPoint format (e.g., Q4.44). These iterations are implemented as a cascade of pipeline stages.
